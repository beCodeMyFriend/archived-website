<p>One of these days I was working in a proposal for a customer and I found that we talk about transparency with these words:</p>
<blockquote><p>Daylight is the best antiseptic</p></blockquote>
<p>This sentence sounds specially attractive to me because is a very simple and accurate definition of what is being transparent in an organization. It's not about having processes to allow the access to the information or nothing like that. It's about having an attitude to protect ourselves from ourselves and from our own fears to the consequences of our mistakes. That's why, instead of fixing the problems when they are already rotten, we prefer to fix them just when they appear.</p>
<blockquote><p>In beCode we believe in good work and honesty, that's why we share all the information about the status of a project in a passive mode, offering total access to our workgroup tools to our customers.<br />
When any kind of issue appears in the project, the customer is the first to be informed no matter the source or the cause of the problem.</p></blockquote>
