<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://aos2012.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Agile Open Space</a> was held last month in Zaragoza, where more than 200 people met to talk about agile methodologies in a relaxing environment. AOS is one of the two "official" events that <a href="http://agile-spain.org/" target="_blank">Agile Spain</a> holds each year with the aid of volunteers. The event takes place in a different city every year, so among the unconditional agilists there are always new faces.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This year the panel was full of talks touching topics ranging from BDD to Retrospectives, and from Inceptions to TDD with Jasmine. My itinerary was:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- "<strong>Digital artisans</strong>" where we could converse with an "analog" artisan who works with silver. He told us we had a romantic conception of what being an artisan is, and that we don't really understand what it means in real life.<br />
- "<strong>Agile freelances</strong>" I entered the talk to listen but I ended explaning how we work at beCode and what I feel it is the natural path of change for a concerned freelance.<br />
- "<strong>Inception</strong>" Quite a lot of people with different levels of knowledge attended, so we barely touched the surface and we only discussed very basic exercises that can be done during an inception. Interesting, though.<br />
- "<strong>Working remotely</strong>" We at beCode are working as a remote team so we wanted to share the lessons learned and to show that "remote" is not the important word (it's "team"!)<br />
- "<strong>You're doomed</strong>" Almost everyone in beCode has a corporate background, we are upset with the actual industry and we're working hard to build a new concept of work, workplace, partnership and customers. We tried to communicate that the time is now and it's up to you to work along with the emerging companies that share this philosophy.<br />
- "<strong>Agile Coaching</strong>" Disappointing, I should have used my two feet but I was low on energy. Although I find the topic interesting, the so guided session made me feel like a fool.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Unexpected</strong><br />
Two unexpected, funny things that happened were the <a href="http://aos2012.wordpress.com/kitaos/" target="_blank">KIT-AOS</a>, an app to consult the AOS panel in your mobile phone made by volunteers and the giving away and interchange of T-Shirts made specially for the occasion, it was like a spanish street market selling clothes!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Corridor Talks</strong><br />
I went to Zaragoza with the idea of proposing a session, but I changed my opinion in the last moment. However, I had corridor talks in which I could talk more directly with people who helped me to make up my mind about my concerns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="AOS 2012 by tracX, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tracx/7541813202/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8163/7541813202_fde19258e6_z.jpg" alt="AOS 2012" width="640" height="427" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An Open Space is much more than the sessions in the panel!</p>
