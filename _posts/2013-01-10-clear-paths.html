<p>I know beCode before it was beCode, I know @XaV1uzz before he even thought about beCode, I've been their first fan and their first critic, but there are paths that need to be clear in order to move forward. In this case, when the obstacle is oneself, it seems to be a lot more difficult to use the machete. The signs don't look so evident when you are in the other side of the lantern, maybe blind by too many lanterns.</p>
<p>Today I'm not part of beCode anymore at a formal level. I won't be again in those daily hangouts to update everyone with our businesses. I also won't share the chat room where sometimes the conversations were too much for any geek-level you can ever imagine. But Â not because of that we will stop finding projects to collaborate or hugging in any of those events. Now we all are simply free to walk our own paths without the ties imposed by the obligation to get on and move together.</p>
<p>Thank you all! I will proudly keep my beCode t-shirt, although now it will stay kept in the drawer more often.</p>
