<p>Marta and Susi are two smart girls who are eager to do something big but starting from an MVP. A few months ago they talked to us because they needed help for building the MVP of Hiphunters</p>
<blockquote><p>Hiphunters is the online platform for those seeking fashion trends and inspiration from different perspectives: street style, brand or stylist proposals, and facilitates the communication between different communities interested in fashion.</p>
<p>The identity of the content creator is very important in Hiphunters. Professionals can have their products online and reach a wider global audience than they could reach with their respective websites. For all other users it is an easy and funny way to find fashion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Working with them has been a pleasure, they quickly understood the way we work, they accepted willingly our proposals and they understood quite well some technical decisions considering that they do not come from the world of software.</p>
<p>We started the project defining with them the backlog and the time and scope for the first iterations. We also decided how often we would hold meetings and in general the way to work together. One of the first measures we put into practice was a daily meeting all together that soon became a daily demo where we showed them the increased functionality. I highly recommend this practice as it forces the maximum level of transparency.</p>
<p>beCode's team was integrated by <a href="www.becodemyfriend.com#team">Emma</a>, <a href="www.becodemyfriend.com#team">Jesus</a> and <a href="www.becodemyfriend.com#team">me</a>. We participated in the development of the project along with Daniel who was involved in the project and who I think is a great developer. Applying beCode usual practices (TDD, CI, code reviews, etc..) was a key to meeting a number of objectives of the project: reliable, tmaintainable software so that the work could be continued by others.</p>
<p>The team was split between Madrid and Valencia which gave us the opportunity to refine the use of the tools that Jesus told us in his series of <a href="http://www.becodemyfriend.com/2012/06/trabajando-en-remoto/">posts</a>. The development was finally finished in eight weeks.</p>
<p>Personally we are very proud of our work and we wish the best for the girls.</p>
