<p>If we dig just a little bit in a random github project we will find a piece of code similar to this</p>
<p><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/uploads/2012/08/guardClause1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3196" title="guardClause1" src="{{site.baseurl}}/uploads/2012/08/guardClause1.png" alt="guard clause" width="575" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>In my opinion this piece of code has at least a problem: the entire content is contained in a conditional clause.</p>
<p>Having all the method content inside a conditional clause is a well known anti-pattern, Beck points at the problem in his book Implementation Patterns (Beck. K, Implementation Patterns. Addison-Wesley, p 70-71)</p>
<p>So we can refactor the code and the result will be</p>
<p><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/uploads/2012/08/guardClause2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3197" title="guardClause2" src="{{site.baseurl}}/uploads/2012/08/guardClause2.png" alt="guard clause refactored" width="575" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>Now the code is more readable and it is clear that there is an exception that don't affect the rest of the method code.</p>
<p>Beck quotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I read the first version, I make a note to look for an else clause while I am reading the then clause. I mentally put the condition on a stack. All of this is a distraction while I am reading the body of the then clause</p></blockquote>
<p>(p. 70)</p>
