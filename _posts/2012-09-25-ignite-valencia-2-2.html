<p>Save the date: October 18th <a href="http://www.ignitevlc.com/?utm_source=becodemyfriend_com&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ignite_2" target="_blank">Ignite</a> Valencia, the speedy presentation event organized by beCode, is back.</p>
<p>Speedy presentations? Each speaker has 5 minutes and 20 slides that advance automatically every 15 seconds. But what makes this format really interesting is that we don't allow our speakers to talk about their project, product or company, but instead we encourage them to talk about their passions.</p>
<p>On the last edition we could see world-class speakers such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqWDraxC8vs" target="_blank">Xavi</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dmLk7P2Xmw" target="_blank">David Bonilla</a>. In this edition we are not going to disappoint you, and we will have speakers on such thrilling subjects as "Collecting Monopoly" and "Jumping out of a perfectly functioning plane@.</p>
