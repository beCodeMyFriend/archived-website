<p><a href="http://baruco.org/" target="_blank">Baruco</a> stands for Barcelona Ruby Conference. It was held during the weekend of the 8th of September in a cool place: inside <a href="http://obrasocial.lacaixa.es/nuestroscentros/cosmocaixabarcelona/elmuseo_ca.html" target="_blank">Cosmocaixa museum</a>.</p>
<p>With excellent organization and grade-a speakers, we could not miss the opportunity to attend this event.</p>
<p><strong>Keynotes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Back to principles</strong> by <a href="http://scottchacon.com/" target="_blank">Scott Chacon</a></p>
<p>Reinvent of your work artefacts, from programming techniques to the concept of holidays. Remove waste, don't take anything for granted, start from scratch to re-think the future of work.</p>
<p><strong>Programming, Motherfucker</strong> by <a href="http://zedshaw.com" target="_blank">Zed A. Shaw</a></p>
<p>A sharp discourse with some horrible slides - maybe on purpose, Zed blamed all the bullshit around coolness, enterprise, agile and community, everything except <a href="http://programming-motherfucker.com/" target="_blank">programming motherfucker</a>. You may like him or not, but his message was that what really matters is just doing things and he advised us not to be fooled by fashion or trends that may keep us away from just doing things.</p>
<p><strong>Talks</strong></p>
<p>We expected it to be a conf about the Ruby language, but it was a mix of talks about technology and programming skills.</p>
<p>There were some talks about the internals of the Ruby language, such as GC, profiling, Rubinius or managing constants, but many others about architecture, protocols, waste and frustation removal, organizations, automatization and agile (OMG, agile in a ruby conf??)</p>
<p><strong>Lightning talks</strong></p>
<p>Some of them were fresh, funny or inspiring, for example comparing roles in a company with a WoW team, or trying to create a gem with the checkmark symbol as its only name.</p>
