<p>During my stay in Valladolid in June I had the oportunity to visit the headquarters of Codice Software, the company behind the successful product <a href="http://www.plasticscm.com/" target="_blank">Plastic SCM</a>. Plastic is a DVCS, a distributed version control system developed in Spain. I met one of the <a href="http://www.plasticscm.com/company/team.aspx" target="_blank">co-founders</a> during an <a href="http://conferencia2011.agile-spain.org/sesiones/" target="_blank">agile conference</a> and I wanted to see how they work from the trenches. So when they invited me to visit them I did not hesitate!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing that surprised me at Codice was how few they were...and the <a href="http://www.abc.es/20120425/local-castilla-leon/abci-codice-software-conquista-asia-201204250846.html" target="_blank">lack of post-its</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Coding</strong></p>
<p>After my remote daily meeting with beCode, I could pair with Dani. He showed me the task he was working on and he explained the portion of code he was developing. I have to admit it is one of the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/954570/definition-of-clean-code" target="_blank">cleanest codes</a> I have ever seen in a company - he told me they had a hard work refactoring and rewriting a big part of the product for its version 4. Good work ;)</p>
<p>Their product is easy to remember once you have seen its branch graph, a bubble graph representing your codebase and its branches. I asked them how they did it: with a lot of math, he replied! No special library for that. They have also developed the rest of algorithms: merge, diff... on their own.</p>
<p><strong>Managing</strong></p>
<p>I went on asking how they manage the software development. It is puzzling, as it is a company with agile values and a big base of testing and clean code and they're happy managing sprints with excel sheets and formulas. That's why they don't use post-its! A bit boring for me, but it seemed to work fine for them!</p>
<p><strong>Testing &amp; Deploying</strong></p>
<p>To finish my stay, Luis show me how they integrate and deploy the product. Although they make feature branching, they do not practice continuos integration. There is one person responsible for integrating the branches and Â selected bugs and he passes all the test in the integration. It is a complex product runned in three OS and several versions of each one, so they instanciate different virtual machines to run all the tests in each OS. They have different layers of test: unit test, smoke (integration) and ui testing and they spend almost a day to run all test to all platforms in each version!</p>
<p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p>
<p>It has been a nice experience and I am greatful to Codice Software for letting me join them for one day and explaining me everything I asked for! I hope to see them in more agile events and meanwhile...have you tried <a href="http://www.plasticscm.com/">their DVCS</a>?</p>
