<p>Last Thursday we celebrated<a title="English Day at beCode" href="http://www.becodemyfriend.com/2011/09/english-day-at-becode/" target="_blank"> English Day </a>open house at beCode. Every Thursday we switch our language to English in order to practice, learn and become more fluent.</p>
<p>Not many people came, but it was such a success. We spent the whole day speaking English. Even pairing, talking about business or writing emails among us. It's exhausting, but worth it!</p>
<p>We'll keep on celebrating these open house days. So stay tuned to our blog and don't miss next beCode's English Day!<br />
<br/><br />
Thanks everybody for coming! =)</p>
