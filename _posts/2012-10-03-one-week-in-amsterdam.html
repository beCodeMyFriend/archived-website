<p><a href="https://twitter.com/elmendalerenda" target="_blank">Mike</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hell03610" target="_blank">I</a> have spent five days in Amsterdam before moving to Berlin. We have visited <a href="http://twitter.com/yurenaghm" target="_blank">Yurena</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/chozero" target="_blank">Tana</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/Titeroygatra" target="_blank">Yeray</a>, our friends from the Canary Islands, Spain, who joined <a href="http://www.startupbootcamp.org/europeans-cities/amsterdam/">Amsterdam Startupbootcamp</a> six months ago. They created a startup called <a href="http://geosophic.com/" target="_blank">Geosophic</a>, a gaming platform for getting behavior analytics and geolocated leaderboards. We have spent the week with them living their “startup experience”, sharing office, expenses, meals and laughs. Geosophic has a great office space in the Vodafone building near Central Station, although sometimes they prefer a quieter atmosphere and they just work from home. Hopefully we have been able to give them something in return by helping them clean up some jQuery mobile parts in their website!</p>
<p>We hope to see Geosophic guys visiting us in Berlin!</p>

<p>After having lived for 10 years in Amsterdam, our partner <a href="https://twitter.com/interruptme" target="_blank">César</a> was eager to give us tips and places to visit. Although we did a bit of “freestyle” tourism, we had time for working and visiting the city, walking along the canals and running away from the tourist mass. We also met <a href="https://twitter.com/yoazt" target="_blank">Joost</a>, a former partner of César, and we even had time to attend a networking event where we met people from <a href="http://www.qestcreativestudios.com/" target="_blank">Qest Creative Studio</a>, a game company. Last but not least, we had a beer with <a href="https://twitter.com/jbeerdev" target="_blank">Jose Cortes</a>, another Spaniard, and an Android developer, who has been living in Amsterdam for four months and who has already fallen in love with the city.</p>
<p>Amsterdam struck us as a pleasant city, with lots of different nationalities and lifestyles coexisting without any problem. It is also an interesting place for devs, startups and freelancers, and it has some regular events worth attending. All in all, Amsterdam seems like a great city to live in, if you can afford the cost of living… and get yourself a bike!</p>
